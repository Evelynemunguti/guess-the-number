# Guess the Number 🎯

A simple JavaScript game where the player tries to guess a random number between 1 and 100.

## 🔍 How It Works

- The computer randomly picks a number from 1 to 100.
- The player enters a guess and clicks the "Guess" button.
- The game tells the player if the guess is too low, too high or correct.
- The game ends when the correct number is guessed.

## 🚀 What I Learned

- How to use `Math.random()` and `Math.floor()` for random numbers
- How to handle user input with JavaScript
- How to use event listeners and update the DOM
- Conditional logic (`if/else`) in JavaScript

## 📁 Files

- `index.html` – structure of the game
- `style.css` – basic styling (optional)
- `script.js` – game logic

## ✅ Future Improvements

- Add score tracking
- Add a restart button
- Improve styling and mobile responsiveness
- Add sound effects or animations
